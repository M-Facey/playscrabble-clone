# PlayScrabble Clone

A hopefully simple partial clone of the playscrabble game

## Inspiration

This project is a partial clone of the [playscrabble](https://playscrabble.com) website. I was deeply interested in creating the game because I thought the interactions and functionality on the site was pretty unique. In fact, I had dare to call them "easy to do" to a friend :grimacing: of mine and now, I've fully learnt the errors on my ways :pensive:. So this is take two on the playscrabble clone.

## Tech Stack

It's divided into two folders: 
- `client` - Vue 3 (front-end)
- `server` - ExpressJS with Typescript (backend)
    - MongoDB?? (database)

## How to Use
Please see the `How to Use` section in the respective folders above.

## Disclaimer
thought_balloon: Here is a few things you should consider:
- Partial clone means I will only be focusing on the game aspect of it and nothing more.
- I am thinking about whether or not, I should publish this site when it's done
